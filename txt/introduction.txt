Proteins are the building blocks of life. 
Each protein is composed by a sequence of amino acids. 
The attraction and repulsion between the amino acids cause the string of amino acid to fold into a 3D structure. 
Figuring out how a sequence of amino acids folds into protein is known as protein-folding problem and has stood as a challenge in biology for the past 50 years. 
AlphaFold[1], an artificial intelligence(AI) tool, produces a leading solution to this problem and is advancing the development of AI for drug discovery paradigm. 
The next important focus is about the interactions between small molecules and proteins, named the protein and small molecule co-folding task. 
In this internship project, I evaluated the performance of two available AI-based tools[2,3] developed for protein and small molecule co-folding with Novartis internal data. 
The goal of this project is to assess their performance and determine suitability for internal drug discovery programs.
