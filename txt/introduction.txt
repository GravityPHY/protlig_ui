Proteins are the building blocks of life. Each protein is composed by a sequence of amino acids. The attraction and repulsion between the amino acids cause the string of amino acid to fold into a 3D structure. Figuring out how a sequence of amino acids folds into protein is known as protein-folding problem and has stood as a challenge in biology for the past 50 years. AlphaFold[1], an artificial intelligence(AI) tool, produces a solution to this problem. The breakthrough leading by AlphaFold advanced the development of AI for drug discovery paradigm, 
and the next important question to focus is the interactions between small molecules and proteins, would AI-based tools provide solution to protein and small molecule co-folding task?
